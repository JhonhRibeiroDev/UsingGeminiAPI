and he was barely holding on with the boosts it provided as ta Kung managed to block Joe pill's
attack both of his teammates launched a joint assault on Joe pill however Joe pill swiftly countered
their attacks effortlessly breaking their weapons and launching two Chi attacks that incapacitated them thinking
it was an opportunity take Kung quickly Unleashed his skill Pierce of the heaven but Joe pill evaded the attack and
retaliated with a relentless Onslaught slicing at TA Kung Phill commended ta
Kung for enduring his attacks and proceeded to use a skill called Divine pal of five the powerful strike sent ta
Kung flying a considerable distance and left him severely injured T Kung struggled to gather strength feeling the
intense heat from the attack to his surprise Joe pill expressed amazement that ta Kung could still stand after
being hit by a fifth Mastery skill with determination ta kyung used his spear to strike at Joe pill narrowing the
distance between them he realized it was his last chance and focused on Gathering as much Chi as he could to strike Joe
pill's vital spot however in a sudden turn of events ta Kung was injured once
again and fell to the ground Joe pill chuckled and taunted ta Kung stating that attempting to circulate Chi blocked
by the Divine palm of fire would lead toqi deviation or even death he added that te kyung should be grateful for
only suffering that extent of damage as Joe pill prepared to deliver the final blow te kyung had a realization
he thought am I really going to die like this that can't be I've survived thousands of battles over the past 7
years but now I'm going to be killed in a game battle suddenly an idea struck
him he remembered that this was just a game just as Joe pill was about to strike ta kung's two teammates caught
Joe pill's attention buying ta K sometime ta Kung exclaimed this whole time I was fighting like an idiot and
equipped a dagger he started using the system to repeatedly equip and unequip the dagger causing damage to Joe pill
infuriated Joe pill Unleashed another Chi attack on te Kung berating him for falling for such a trick walking towards
ta kyung Joe pill unleashed the Divine palm of fire once again he questioned ta
kyung asking how he could have done anything when he was empty-handed with a laugh T kyung revealed that he had been
waiting for Joe pill to gather his Chi to its peak causing a blockage and backflow of chi he taunted Joe pill
calling him a shitty bastard Joe pill suffered severe injuries and T Kung believed that it was finally over he
thought that Joe pill wouldn't be able to attack him in that state exhausted ta Kung called for his teammates to come
and help him however to TA kung's surprise Joe pill stood up and declared himself as the 19th successor of the
Divine palm of fire he stated that he should never lose to a nobody like taay kyung confused taay kyung wondered what
was happening he had thought Joe pill had fallen into cheat deviation it became clear to him that Joe pill was
barely holding on and was burning up his life force heung thought do you really have to go that far just to kill me
consumed by desperation T kyung ingested the unknown Chi and immediately felt a surge of strength coursing through him
back to a memory he used Spear and cause huge damage which suppose a f-rank hunter unable to do so even though
people are surprised that a f-rank hunter can cast a skill which around d rank power but his physical body and
Mona pool is still a f-rank hunter so that the conclusion he got got for master is he have to strengthening
foundation and basic skill possess outstanding techniques and exceptional battle sense but in any case if you want
to live a long life he should not use that skill anymore unless in special circumstances like life is endangered
his master question did you give a name to that skill of yours back to mirams the name of the skill is piercing with
all my mind system alerted you have completed your quest you have defeated one word One strike Joe pill your reward
has been given last moment SEO Chun run to head slices off Joe pill head for Revenge back to
take K memories during a raid they found a huge amount of magic gems leader felt
strange regarding this situation because the menter they have been facing have all been but these common goblins so it
does not make sense that there are this many Magic gems but take kyung as vice leader said I think you are the strange
one if you want to abandon a raid as amazing as this and it looks like all of the team members want to finish it as
well end up all of them got killed before leader die he told take Kung hurry and run coming back to
Consciousness take Kung woke up from his unconscious State why Pang told him you have been unconscious for 5 days since
you were in critical condition the head physician stated that you probably would not even make it to the next day after
hearing those words my Lord became extremely enraged if I was not there to stop him he would have probably beat the
head physician to death he kyung questions so asides from that nothing major happened why Pang first to tell
them the good news the survivors from the shashua region have all safely returned back to their homes from your
group only two suffered injuries but they were not in life-threatening conditions and we recovered the died
member corpse we were also able to give him a proper burial but it seems he was an orphan so we did not have any
families to pass on his belongings spotted take Kung upset condition why Pang told him a marshal Warrior is not
someone who seeks to receive protection but rather a marshall Warrior must fight enemies in in order to prove their
existence even if the opponent they encounter kills them as they are much stronger than them that is why the ones
who are living must remember them in their hearts and carry them to the place of their dreams so that their deaths
will not have been in vain he kyung said I wonder what his dream was why Pang replied he wanted to become the greatest
Marshall Master under the heavens why Pang continued now I shall tell you the even better news two days ago a big
battle had ensued at hang a battle took place between 100 Elite Warriors from
the main family and 200 Vanguard Warriors from the mount hang sword sect in short the main family achieved a
decisive Victory only 30 Warriors from the mount hang sword SE managed to survive and Escape which was the same
number as the injured warriors on our side although we failed to capture liso Guang the Lesser family head of the
mount hang sword sect we were successful in defeating the two Marshall Masters in the peak realm who were under his
command they were known as the twin Demons of Mount hang heung questioned if the head Elder had defeated them why
Pang replied it was me and my Lord who fought them individually K Kung thought my fight with Joe pill almost got me
killed but here's this guy fighting against a marshall Master of the same spiritual realm as my opponent this dude
is definitely a monster why Pang continued I must say I'm impressed by your performance one word One strike Joe
pill words can't express how astonished I am however considering the number of
times you have caused trouble for us it still makes my blood boil nobody expected this outcome the third young
master who used to squander the family's funds and waste his time in brothel the same one who would stumble around drunk
on the streets and tarnish the family's name has now become a respectable and dependable figure I why Pang am quite
impressed although I hate to admit it KQ thought just curse at me instead of being passive aggressive you bastard he
Kung explained I was just lucky it was also because Joe pill let his guard down
y Pang replied that's not the case it was purely a difference in skill losing
because you let your guard down or because the opponent had a secret weapon are just excuses if that's all it took
to defeat the infamous Joe pill he wouldn't have earned his title in the first place Only the strongest can
survive in this world of Miram excitedly T Kung exclaimed then that means I was
just stronger than Joe pill why Pang retorted what the hell are you talking about it's obvious that Joe pill is much
stronger than you do you think a Marshall master in the peak realm is a joke why Kung added in any case the
mount hang sword sect has suffered a severe Blow from this incident they lost their justification for starting this
war as the third young Master of the Jin family of taian is strong enough to rely on his own abilities and doesn't need
cheap tricks like poison indeed I have finally arrived why kyung ran towards ta
Kong and embraced him at that moment take Kung thought please just leave me alone meanwhile in Mount H sect they
they are mad regarding they lost two Marshall master in the peak realm these losses occurred because they were
overconfident in ourselves and let our guards down now they have 4 days after 4
days they shall attack the Jin family of taian once more traditional doctor was surprised and said for the past 10 years
that I have worked at the infirmary this is my first time seeing something like this he Kung thought so even leveling up
does not give me a full recovery well that is good it would have been hard to avoid any suspicions if I recovered
everything anyway traditional doctor continue even if the recovery effects of the 100-year jinang is caner divine this
is way too fast he Kung thought what does that have anything to do with me you old geizer traditional doctor
explained I almost forgot you lost your memories about a year ago there was a time when the medicinal Hall storage was
completely cleaned out the head physician was enraged even if you have money acquiring a 100-year ginang is not
an easy task but you consumed a spiritual medicine that can instantly increase your internal Chi by 20 years
then ta kyung realized that unknown Chi has come from that he Kung thought my precious 100-year Jin say I can't
believe I consumed it without even realizing how amsing that was I am going crazy I did not know it was that
previous but that was the only thing I could during that situation no T Kung is level 30 Chi and Reed as well and also
gain a lot of Fame and also got a brand new skill one strike but take K wonder
it is just the name different it is same as my piercing with all my might but the important part is that since my body in
real life is that of a f-rank hunter using that skill once was my limit but now that I am in the body of a level 30
Marshall Warrior I should be able to use that skill more than once right he noticed the rumors became bigger than he
thought well this is a bit embarrassing but even still it is not a bad feeling who knows when he will get a chance like
this again but it is also because of why kyung too he wanted to prove to people that the rumors were true that he did
that to TA kyung back then he kyung thought I was so embarrassed that I wanted to [ __ ] hide in the jungle
this is why games are so scare I am starting to enjoy the life of the Jen T Kung in the Miram
[Music] game K Kung thought there were only two more conditions he needed to meet in
order to log out since his Fame was Rising automatically as more people heard about the rumor he just needed to
wait he had planned to use the chi from the 100-year G s to see the difference between the First Rate and second rate
but he blew that opportunity so ta Kong decided to get the answer from Wong why
Kung informed him that the mount hang sword sect was planning to recruit more soldiers and he planned to attack their
main forces before they had the chance to do so the battle would begin in 2 days he Kung wondered ah why is it so
soon will I be able to log out before then why Kung continued thankfully the five gates of Shan sin with whom the
main family has always maintained a good relation ship have decided to assist us so I wish for you to take a part of
their forces and protect our rear as T Kung accepted the quest his quest reward Fame Rose by 10 then taay Kung
questioned whether he was still in the second rate realm but why Kung interrupted and said you are a First
Rate already in the following conversation ta Kung was very sure that he was a second rate Warrior but why
kyung told him you're definitely a First Rate Warrior when why Kung asked who told you that you were a second rate
Warrior hey Kung couldn't explain and simply said that he just thought he was still a second rate Warrior why kyung
wrote a word on the table sing which means belief why Kong told him you just have to believe in yourself it has
everything to do with it martial arts begins with belief at that moment take Kung wondered what do I believe what
have I been believing in this whole time the system the reason why I kept thinking I was a second rate Warrior was
because the system kept telling me I was a second rate Warrior but was not the system designed to only tell me the
truth but according to W kyung he was already a First Rate Warrior and if what the system said was not a lie then the
fact that he believed he was still a second rate Warrior was because the system was a mere reflection of himself
he was able to defeat a First Rate Warrior seun took down a group of mercenaries all by himself and even
killed a marshall master in the peak realm ah then there is no way I am still a second rate Warrior he Kung proudly
said I am already a First Rate Warrior the system alerted him that he had attained the first r spiritual realm the
Realms of his skills had increased by one as well and his external and internal state had significantly
improved the base of his abdomen had increased the next day ta kung's Fame had risen as everybody heard his story
while he went to the market to raise his Fame he met Jun the protector of the third gate and an assistant from the
five gates Kung thanked him for coming this far to assist them and told them he would take his leave to the medicinal
hall right away Han yop and mu Jin recalled Joe pill's one Palm strike and wondered if he was really a monster Han
yop set a target for himself believing that when he became a marshall master in the peak realm he would become stronger
muin said I will be the one to accomplish that he Kung never went in and felt cringey when he listened to the
two of them filming their own drama in there he thought IID planned to bid them farewell Before the War Began but let's
just go I should just be satisfied with seeing their faces SE you'll noticed taay Kong and exclaimed it is Mr savior
she brought taay Kong to visit uncle gong and SE shun Uncle gong was practically all healed he had been
recuperating for a long time and asked I heard that a big war will begin soon I hope everything is going well in terms
of preparation K kyung was speechless and thought we not the main forces the only ones who knew about this if someone
like gong who has been spending his entire time in the infirmary knows about this news then doesn't that mean
practically everyone in the Jinn family of taan is aware of this as well what if a spy from the mount hang sword sect
hears about this news k k side and wondered whatever it's not like it matters since it will have nothing to do
with me he replied everything is progressing smoothly Uncle gong continued since it is a battle that will
decided the fate of the family I am sure the young Master is quite concerned I am glad I was able to recover the
belongings you left behind since you were unconscious these are the items that you were not able to recover please
open it when you get the chance if possible a away from suspicious eyes soon T Kung find out martial arts scroll
Divine palm of fire a rank PE burning flames pill and a nameless sword he Kung said if you were planning to give me
these amazing items should have done so from the start of this game it is pretty obvious that you're trying to make me
play this game for a bit longer he Kung imagine what if I consume that spiritual pill and also learn to utilize the
Divine palm of fire I can probably summon fire for my hands just like Joe pill but very quick take Kung wonder
what if it burned off himself safety is his number one priority let's never forget that the moment I start to stray
away from that path I will be killed he kyung pondered yeah I am almost there I just need to focus on staying safe until
I get out of this place meanwhile in another location a man with a hood questioned the head Elder is everything
under control the head Elder replied don't worry I have finished preparing everything the head Elder thought the
day the two great families of the province of shanai collide with one another everything will finally come to
an end and a new era shall begin I shall become the family head of the Jin family of taian and I shall reunite the
province of shanai and become its ruler soon take kyung question why muin are
here are not you supposed to be at the infirmary mu Jin did not want to miss out on a battle that involves the name
of our family why kyung came to find T kyung why kyung told him you have been assigned to be on rear guard Duty and
will only a few Marshall Warriors of our faction K kyung requested from W kyung for some other Mission as he thought
accept Mission equal to accomplish a great deed than he can get experience in Fame K kyung said since my body is
completely healed I want to accomplish a great deed for the main family why kyung replied is that you have been thinking
about this whole time what an admirable thought thank you my little brother but I'm afraid I can't do so hey kyong ask
then can you give me a reconnaissance mission or something I can go and check if there are enemies lying in Ambush
over there why K tell them you have already been assigned to one of the most important duties for us to survive you
must do whatever you can in order to survive even if the main family is on the verge of Destruction you must run as
far as you can if the root survives then the tree will grow once more you and the second
younger brother are both capable of becoming an even greater figure than I so please keep that in mind that is your
mission next day T kyung is on his way at ding Crossing June also assigned to be on rear guard Duty he felt pretty
disappointed to be assigned for this position June said well not only does it diminish our chance of accomplishing a
great deed but it also reduces our chance of witnessing the great Lord's blade of flow although the Lesser family
had and esteemed figure like you is participating in this battle the existence of the blade of flow is known
all throughout the mainland heung thought ah he is talking about the head Elder June continue he is a hero that
was born during the times of the Great War of the Orthodox and unorthodox and he was known as honorable Warrior who
would not tolerate any Injustice from following conversation June continued describe how amazing head Elder was and
when T kyung questioned I guess you are confident that we are going to win June replied I am certain we will win we will
prevail on the night of our second March we arrived at Hue Jin W kyung gathered
all of the commanders for a meeting he predicted that due to the dwindling Food Supplies of our enemies amongst the four
routes they can take in order to arrive at ding sing he came to the conclusion that they would take only one possible
route and decided to position our troops at the place the eight spring Gorge the entrance to this Gorge is very narrow
and shaped like a jar and has very steep edges so it is a good place to set up an ambush not to mention with the help of
the lower District sex Wu we were able to position about 100 Archers on the Cliff's Edge beforehand and at dawn 300
Warriors of the Jin family of taian and 150 assisted Warriors of the faction in
total 450 forces made their way to the gorge Kung thought even though that was last time I had see him I never got to
give him a proper farewell tunk's face scared his team member T kyung watch on his Fame only three remaining new Jin
point on T kung's item what is that I have never seen those belongings before K Kung replied it is a marshal scroll
and spiritual pill if you consume the pill it will boost your internal Chi by 30 years but apparently you will burn to
death if you take the spiritual pill when you are not ready for it you want to eat it mu Jin replied nah I am good
enjy learning your Transcendence ranked martial arts and stuff your face full with those spiritual pills K kyung told
him I am serious you little [ __ ] it is because I don't need these things anymore suddenly June said I guess by
now the war has begun shall we start moving as well new Jin told Jun our mission is to stay here with the third
young master in order to protect their rear he Kung thought I don't remember seeing them wearing those clothes before
hey Kung wonder I'm getting a bad feeling about this June said well that's conflicting it seems the mission that I
have received is different from yours hey Kung question how so Jun laughed and said your senses are sharp if that is
the case I guess I will have no choice but to tell you what that person has told me to do kill all of them and
regroup with the main Force mujin has no idea how strong is they ta Kung pull him
back telling him they are not a bunch of weaklings T Kung thought they are all First Rate Warriors should I spent 4
days with them and I was not aware of that fact I've been too focused on logging out system alerted eliminate the
Assassins Quest reward gain exp been Fame chain Quest progression June laughed and said I wonder how long you
can withstand our attacks but soon June was shocked and wondered where the hell is he getting those weapons from K Kung
instantly took out most of his men and June noticed another sight which was supposed not to be a problem in the next
second he wondered if our information regarding them is completely wrong he Kung cast his one strike and cleaned
them off Jun thought he is a Transcendence ranked Marshall master I need to hurry and get out of here heung
pointed his spear at him and said don't move if you want to live now answer my questions then you will die a painless
death after all June said the Protectors of the third gate were created for the sole purpose of serving that man this
was the great plan that he has been preparing for over 30 years heung wondered the only person who could have
planned something like this for over 30 years in the province of shanii can only be one person the head Elder but for
what purpose he thought he was the one who blamed why kyung for the deaths of those kids and was also the one who
suspended the political Strife within the family it was thanks to him that the Jinn family of taian was unified for the
upcoming battles wait a moment K kyung questioned muen the new recruit from the faction how many of them joined us for
this battle mujin replied if you combine the Protectors of the third gate and the Imperial guards that is a little over
100 Warriors KY young asked what if you include the Warriors from the head Elders political faction muin answered
then more than half of our forces are from that faction K kyung realized that he helped why kyong unify the family
just for this day he did that in order to gain everything from this one battle the forces of the main family are in
trouble Kung yelled we are going to depart immediately hurry and get ready Jun laughed saying it is already too
late me you the Jin family of taian as well as the mount hang sword sect the
great plan has already begun and with that he died from the poison the system alerted you have completed the quest you
have attained 500 Fame K kyung thought ah I can finally go back home but I am
sorry please wait for me a bit longer there is something I have to do right now the system alerted after 3 seconds
you will be logged out before he returned to the real world other members noticed that ta Kung had become
unconscious in real world ta Kung tried to open Quest menu and inventory he was
happy that he have finally returned he wonder how long has it been it feels like it has been ages since I have last
been in this room T KY said I went through all of that [ __ ] because of your [ __ ] snores jinho questioned are you [ __ ]
out of your mind an idiot slams the neck of a person who was sleeping peacefully in order to state that they have been
trapped in a virtual reality forever a month but if you look at the time it has only been 3 hours not to mention the
capsule they were in was an ancient piece of junk that probably belongs in a museum K Kung thought I am not sure
either to think 30 days would only add up to being 3 hours K kyung was mad and put the helmet on Jin Ho's head tell him
try it out for yourself after 10 minutes Jin ho opened the capsule and then he took out the cable of capsule behind
telling him how the hell am I supposed to play this game if this capsule is not even powered in the first place you
stupid idiot he k pondered then what was the game that I played was it all a dream or did I finally go insane no I
can still remember everything clearly it was not an illusion suddenly he recalled back there is a user's manual then he
took out and have a look a capsule manufactured for one specific individual immense time manipulation in order to
maximize Play Time character sync system a player will automatically become synced with the engame character and
will both experience a sense of unity he Kung thought so there is also the time manipulation will mu Jin and the rest of
my men be able to safely deliver the news regarding the Betrayal of the head Elder to W kyong will W Kong be able to
successfully defend the head Elders attack he Kung wonders since being in the game for 1 month was about 3 hours
in real life I still got some time thank god well I am sure they are doing fine
they can probably solve all of this on their own there is no need for me to be so worried about them when take Kung
look on sync system he could not understand what does it mean by a character and a player being in sync
with one another he kyung tried to once again open character profile find out it still does not work he is not sure how
much of this could believe one the sun rose T Kung went to every single store that specializes in selling VR capsule
products and looked at all of the newest capsule models that were currently in the market Bo there were not any models
that were the same as the one that I had I also looked at ones that stated that they had realistic graphic that were
over 70% identical to the real world but the NPC's movement and interaction with a player in the game were very rough and
way too unnatural compared to the game that I played not to mention nobody seemed to know or heard about the game
mirum login since I was not able to find anything on my own I decided to take the users's manual and have Jin ho look over
it since he was a VR game Enthusiast in the end even J ho did not seem to know
anything about the company H sof and had never heard of the arc 2020 VR capsule
model but most unbelievable thing was Jin ho was only able to view the first page and he was not able to view any of
the other pages that was the Dilemma that was in for some time he kyung called her sister and questioned how his
mom he Kung thought if I also heard my mother's voice right now I am pretty sure I won't be able to hold back my
tears in the real world it has only been a day since I have last seen them I wonder what would have happened if I
never came back that does not matter what matters is that I have finally returned back to my world I have my
family that I need to protect here I will just go with that I briefly had a very strange dream the kind of dream
that Fades away as time goes on I just need to focus on living my life in the real world next day te kyung went to
work at 6:00 a.m. much earlier than usual Jin ho looked at taay kyung with Wonder after all his nonsense about
Miram and Crimson flow [ __ ] he guessed that taay kyung had finally thrown away the piece of junk but even still ta
kyung seemed pretty adamant about the whole thing Jin ho was pretty sure he was just bluffing but he guessed it
wouldn't hurt to do his own research T young thought about the rough guy whose real name name he didn't know but he was
the first hunter that ta Kung met when he started out he knew that the rough guy had been working as a hunter for a
really long time so it was a bit surprising that he was still working as one k Kung told the rough guy that he
was just fired from the picnic Guild yesterday the rough guy laughed at the name of the guild saying it was pretty
dumb he commented it's not like you're going on a picnic inside a gate after the announcement T kyung learned that
the rough guy's name is hak Jun an e- rank Hunter K kyung wondered when he became an e rank Hunter considering he
was a married man he guessed that hu Jun had worked his ass off all this time because becoming an e- rank Hunter was
not an easy task after waiting for all the e- rank Hunters to gather in the main lobby finally until F rank Hunter T
kyung Ming wo from peace Guild passed Tay kyung a contract to sign they were heading to an e- rank gate and taay
kyung's base pay would be 30 with an adjusted pay of 8 to2 with a peace Guild taking 20% at first T kyung thought the
carrier pay was so generous but his perception changed after a conversation in the car he realized that it was due
to hak jun's recommendation that he was able to join this party most of the other hunters in the car were also -
rank Hunters the gate they were going to was one of the few remnants left over by the great catastrophe these Gates served
as the invasion route taken by The Demon King asmodus about 30 years ago however
they quickly became a source of income for hunters and a place to gather high energy resources inside the gate
anything not powered by Magic would quickly deteriorate and become useless Hunters had to use gear forged by Magic
gems as a result as their pay Rose so did their expenses T kung's gear had
never changed since he started 7 years ago however when leader Ming Wu appeared taay Kung exclaimed holy [ __ ] isn't that
the Crimson Dragon set Ming Wu introduced his gear made from five different types of magic and some ranked
magic gems the height of the Crimson Drake was popular because of its special gloss primarily for looks rather than
providing providing many benefits Ming Wu was a gear geek and was happy whenever someone noticed his gears he
Kung questioned where the rest of the peace Guild members were yep June explained that it was an extremely new
Guild so they didn't have any members yet including the guild leader there were only three of them in total hu Jun
reassured TA kyung by mentioning that Ming Wu was a c rank Hunter so there was no need to worry soon they encountered
goblins and Ming wo instructed them to get into formation range dealers were to move back and tanks were to be at the
front Ming Wu assured them that he would take care of the rest heang thought to himself so that's the power of a c rank
Hunter Ming Wu was a good fighter but if this was in the mirum world ta Kung believed his skills would probably be
that of a First Rate Warrior ta Kung noticed a goblin trying to escape and wondered if he should try his skills
however before he could act minwoo sword swiftly pierced the Goblin's head and Ming Wu told Tay kyong to quickly
collect their profits they eventually reached a huge door leading to the boss Zone Ming wo realized that something was
wrong as the goblin priest seemed to be gathering The Souls of the Dead goblins suddenly the goblin Mage cast a spell
and closed the door hu Jun tried to open it but failed Ming Wu revealed that it was a hobgoblin Chief priest a c rank
rare monster there was also a hobgoblin Chief Warrior another C rank rare monster they knew they were in trouble
Ming wo explained that if they could kill the chief priest first they would still have a chance of survival he asked
the others to temporarily keep the chief Warrior occupied while he went after the priest they needed to hold the chief
Warrior back for 5 minutes Ming woo sprinted toward the priest Goblin and T kyung thought to himself they say that
unlucky bastards will even break their noses when they fall backward I can't believe I'm facing an intermediate boss
monster worth $300 not one but two as well besides I thought you guys told me
not to fight you [ __ ] said I was just a luggage Boy The Warrior hobgoblin charged at them launching a jump strike
that sent the formation team flying hiu Jun told ta Kung to take the others and hide while he kept the monster
distracted hiu Jun cast strength and shield enhancement and charged his attack however with a single hit the
warrior hobgoblin defeated him heung thought to himself why do [ __ ] like this keep happening to me if this goes on
everyone's going to die again it's up to me now I will need to do whatever I can to stop that bastard please let it work
come on just as the warrior hobgoblin was about to strike him the system alerted him that synchronization was
complete and his system had been transferred in that moment T Kung could feel his chief he took out his Spear and
defended himself using Chi sensation he thought to himself interesting so this
is how it's going to be heyong employed the Jin family's footwork technique to dodge all the attacks and use the Jin
family spear technique first mode brutal head of the Dragon second mode Whirlwind
of the black snake as he followed these spear techniques te KY said I guess I didn't even have to use my one strike
skill on you Ming Wu questioned te Kong asking what is your true identity after
the raid the people in charge of the gates were thrown into an uproar two mid-tier rare monsters were found inside
an e- rank gate and only four e- rank Hunters were injured luckily not critically according to the law the
government is required to compensate for damages to gear medical bills and lost raid rewards combining everything earned
from this raid they made quite a profit leader minwoo after the injured ERS were transported to an ambulance was escorted
to the Civil Service Department to give his report K Kung sat in the car and opened his character profile noticing
that the things that affected him in the mirum world had all disappeared curious ta kyung opened the quest menu and saw
that the quest betrayer was still active he wondered if it was telling him to go back to the Miram world the fact that
the system could exist in the real world made him question if the mam world was not just a game but something more
suddenly Ming Wu returned and startled Tay K young by looking at him through the window Ming wo informed him that he
had given a quick report on the incident and expected to be contacted within the next few days he also mentioned that tay
kyong would likely be investigated as well T kyong asked Ming Wu about the request he made earlier requesting Ming
Wu to keep the secret for him T Kong thought that since he didn't know if the system would be permanent or temporary
it would be best to avoid any leaks to the public mingu showed T Kang his watch and asked him to take a look he K said
it was 2:00 Ming Wu explained that the watch was made by n company using a c rank magic jam and had defensive
enchantments allowing it to be used as a shield in emergencies Ming woo suggested grabbing some food during their
conversation he revealed that he was the one who subjugated both the chief priest and the warrior to those officers Ming
Wu then asked taay kyung if he would join his Guild recalling their previous conversation ta kyong had told Ming Wu
that he had something important to take care of and needed time to think about joining The Guild Ming Wu had asked
someone to investigate ta Kung to gather more information the investigation revealed that tay kyung was the sole
survivor of the gate that appeared in the sangdong district and was at least a c rank Hunter however he was supposedly
an f-rank Hunter Ming Wu wondered if ta kyung had been hiding his strength all this time or had recently experienced
another Awakening he doubted ta kyung had a reason to hide his strength so the highest probability was that he had
recently awakened Ming Wu questioned whether it was possible for someone to go from F rank to C rank so quickly he
realized that they weren't living in a game and was shocked when the cashier told him the total cost was
$1,938 meanwhile te KY young went back to the place where he had thrown the capsule but it was nowhere to be found
frustrated he yelled wondering who took his capsule Jin ho yelled from the top
admitting that he was the one who picked it up he kyung instantly replied with I love you jinho then informed T kyung
that he would sell the VR game capsule for $100 he kyung had no choice but to buy it back he kyung thought to himself
how it felt like yesterday when when he was struggling looking at flyers and pamphlets for work he couldn't believe
that he was now being recognized and scouted he remembered Ming who offering him $100,000 as a down payment and the
same wage as their C rank Hunters however he had concerns about the system disappearing he Kung compared it to
eating too much food and getting a stomach ache he had realized at a young age that the world was not forgiving but
with the strength he had now he wondered if he could use the system permanently unable to hold himself back any longer
take K decided to go for the hunter ranking re-evaluation he arrived at the hunter Association this guy is taay
kyung's former boss Kim sang Chic he overheard someone discussing a person with Mona control ability above a rank
and realized this was a great opportunity for him if he could recruit this person into their Guild he could
potentially become a vice Guild Master sang Chic bow in hands over his name card while the escalator door open but
next second sang shik felt the sound was so familiar sang shik saw ta kyung when he turned his head sang shik was one of
the 3D rank hunters in the guild and was known for bullying the weak especially f- rank Hunters he had despised T Kung
the most and had played a part in his dismissal from The Guild two years ago Kung felt relieved as if years of Burden
had been lifted sang shik ran toward ta young apologizing and begging for forgiveness he offered to take
responsibility and hoped they could let bygones be bygones Kung sense sang Sheik's panic and realized that if the
Guild Master of the sapun guild heard about him Reawakening in to a c rank Hunter sang shik would be in a lot of
trouble Kung told sang shik that if he wanted to recruit him he should ensure that one particular person is not
present sang shik infuriated attempted to punch ta kyung but was countered and sent flying soon ta kyung received a
message for Ming Wu to meet up Ming Wu passed him a temporary contract Ming Wu said conditions of this contract is
similar to that of a b rank Hunter you also decide on the length of your contract as well will you really refuse
this as well Kung curious and question why are you going this far for someone like me Ming wo replied because I trust
myself I trust my intuition and ability to determine the value of a person that is why I really want someone like you in
my guild he Kung signed the contract and wonder 7 days should be enough for me to see if the system is a temporary thing
or not then Ming Wu immediately brought Tay Kong to a d rank gate Ming Wu just bought over this gate which shock t k in
South Korea the gates are the property of the nation since these Gates have the ability to provide unlimited amounts of
energy for magic gems gates are pretty much considered the same as a diamond mine K kyung pondered so you were
telling me he was able to have all of that for himself I know he was the son of a rich family but I did not think he
would be this well off leader minwoo just who are you Ming Wu said the monsters that appear in this gate are
the swamp lizardmen they are a large tribe that break off into smaller militaristic forces they are usually in
a group of 20 so let's hurry and kill them and move on back to a memory take Kung was shocked when Ming W tell him
only two of them entering this Gate C until Ming Wu told him that he is also a reawaken hunter C rank is his old rank
he received Reawakening after that heung thought it means he is at least to be rank or even higher I was a bit caught
off guard last time but I guess I will be able to see just how strong he is now while T Kung Cas CH sense a harpoon from
Lizardman throw to him Ming wo reminds him be careful he then noticed they are here he blocked a few Harpoon and El man
dashing toward their Direction heung said it must not be scared since it is attacking us alone Ming Wu explained
that is the lizard man's characteristic they are rash creatures that prefer taking fights head on heung wonder
should I just stay behind him in order to not get in his way next second the lizard men start attack ta Kung only
then Ming Wu explain it is because of your gear T Kung look at the inventory only find out the weapon and gear all
his Lizardman set he Kung question Ming Wu did you do this on purpose you were planning to kill these guys while I kept
them distracted that was your plan all along Ming Wu denied and said first of all you chose those gears second
regardless or what happened I will not making a single move during this raid so please don't misunderstand k kyung then
realized he need to fight by himself K Kung keep on blocking attack from Lizardman until take kyung Furious and
tell lizard stop pissing me off soon due to the effects applied by Lizardman said
take Kung dealt an additional 10 plus 20% system alerted you have single-handedly taken care of the
Lizardman in the surrounding area make sure to stay on guard as these monsters will not stop to fulfill their Vengeance
after eliminated these lizard men take Kung point on Ming Wu question why he do that Ming Wu apologized and explained he
want to figure out how far I can take you with me so I needed to know how you move and how many opponents you can take
on I was confident that you would be able to take care of them on your own but I never expected for you to take
care of them without suffering a single scratch K Kung smirk and said well you should have told me your plans
beforehand what would have happened if I was not as strong as you thought so what is your verdict Ming woo replied I am
not sure and took out a pheromone shoot to Sky it is something were harvested from the female lizardmen next second
they listened a huge amount of Lizardman moving forward here Ming Wu said the effects are quite strong do you think
you can take them on K Ken questioned if I told you that I can't you help me out the answer is nope system alert lv52
Chief Lizardman appeared skill battlecry is being used Ming Wu told him you could always Retreat he kyung told him there
is no need for me to do that he kyung opens character profile distribute 30 points to strength and stamina each and
40 into agility and he cast one stke Ming Wu shocked and wonder how a recently reawakened C rank Hunter can do
something like this that day when we went to the e- rank the rare monster he took down required the power of two c
rank Hunters but the strength he is now you were telling me he is supposed to be a c rank Hunter what a joke I went on
this two man man raid because I wanted to see his limits but now I am even more confused than before I guess we have to
go to a c rank gate next time mingu thought wait is it possible that he is stronger than me next moment T kyung
cried and said this is not supposed like this I damaged an expensive piece of leather Ming wo thanks t kyung for today
but when ta kyung questioned what time should he come tomorrow he was shocked that weekend after work he told him that
the purpose of the weekend is to rest it is required by law that Hunter do this did your previous Guild force you to
work on weekends as well K kyung replied what kind of a mid-tier guild follows that rule they let us go on these raids
by adding more to our wage and since we don't want these raids to be left on our records we are usually paid with cash
Ming Wu said you were a c rank Hunter now there is no need for you to live your life like that you are only going
to Tire yourself out please think about family Kung thought now that I think about it I've only been able to talk to
them over the phone I have not had the chance to visit them has it been 2 months no if I include my time in the
mirum world it has been about 3 months already Kung wondered but this leader since he is so adamant about rest I
guess he is a decent nope he is evil he made me run three C rank gates in one
day there is no way he is a decent guy the [ __ ] he made me go through for the past 4 days is enough to piss me off
again it is obvious that he is making me rest during the weekend because he wants to abuse me again next week I feel bad
for the butler as well he's unable to depart even though it is pretty late Ming wo's driver passes him
weekly payment Ming wo said he put a little more than what the contract stated after Ming Wu leaving ta Kung
opened it and he checked the balance statement says the total is $330,000 but what at this the bonus is
$270,000 at this moment T kyung recalled back Ming W said I put in a little more than what the contract stated T kyung
Wonder a god men woo I will offer my entire body to your guild soon take Kung back to his home visit his mom mom and
sister he passed them some money and showed them his C rank hunter's license then they go shopping and having dinner
next day his sister wake him up question were you having a nightmare why are you screaming in your sleep hey K wonder it
was a dream but what I was even dreaming about I can't remember but what was with his shitty feeling usually when I sleep
the system does a good job adjusting my body's condition his sister question did something bad happen to you if something
did happen let me know stop shouldering all of the burden by yourself he Kung explained no I have pretty much got all
of our living expenses covered so what is there for me to worry about the only thing I am worried about is how are we
going to spend all of our money from now on aside there is no need for you to worry about me just focus on your
studies his sister said you are bluffing I am doing fine as well so you don't have to worry about me while she leaving
she questioned out right who is Jin y Kung later on T kyung and Ming Su went
to another raid Ming Su said three times that is the amount of times you have gotten hurt today he kyung said it is
fine I can easily take care of this by drinking a low rank potion Ming Su point out this is not fine this is the same
gate as the one we ran last time you did not suffer a single injury back then that means there is only one possible
explanation for this Mr Jin T kyung is there something bothering you 3 Days Later Ming Su said this is not going to
work I will contact you later you can go home for today he Kung wonder what is wrong with me the system has not
disappeared and I still have a [ __ ] ton of money to go around all that is left for me is to just focus on my duties as
a c rank Hunter T kyung recalled back the conversation with his sister Tung questioned where did you hear that name
his sister said from you you kept yelling his name in your sleep why who is this person if you are calling for
this person's name in your sleep you must be pretty close to them not to mention your names are pretty similar he
Kung thought everything went downhill since that day the nightmares would not end and no matter how many times I use
my chi circulation I can't seem to make my body focus why do I keep thinking about him maybe I need to see a
psychologist K kyung back to his room find out jinho want to did something to the capsule K kyung told him not to come
inside my room
